Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

In the heart of Dublin, in the middle of O'Cornell St, there is a very tall and shiny pole. [The Dublin Spire](https://www.visitdublin.com/the-spire), standing at 120 meters tall, offers absolutely nothing and costs the city more than €84k each year in its upkeep. The Spike stands out from the rest of the city, being the tallest publicly accessable structure in Dublin, and is widely disliked by locals. If you ever find yourself lost in the streets of Dublin, just follow the giant tower and you'll figure out where you are. (Contributor: E. Liu)
