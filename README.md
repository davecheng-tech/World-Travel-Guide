Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

The crashing waters of [Niagara Falls](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154998-d186167-Reviews-Niagara_Falls_Canada-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html)—comprising two American falls and one Canadian—are truly a sight to behold. Get up close on a boat ride (be prepared to get soaked!), enjoy amazing aerial views from the Skylon Tower or on a helicopter tour, stroll along the White Water Walk, or hit the Journey Behind the Falls attraction that offers views of the falls from below and behind. Adventure seekers can also go zip-lining, jet-boating, hiking and cycling with the falls as the backdrop. For a truly magical experience, stay after dark when the falls are illuminated. For peak water flow, visit between June and August. – Tripadvisor (Contributor: Edric)
