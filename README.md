Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

#### Why do I like Fairview
(Contributor: Joel Menezes) I like [Fairview mall](https://shops.cadillacfairview.com/property/cf-fairview-mall) since I have grown up around the area, and it is a nice walkable neighbourhood in the uppercore of Toronto, and the heart of North York. I used to go there all the time, and still go when I find the time. Since it is close to my house, I do sometimes find my self there or in the area after school, but not often.
