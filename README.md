Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

[The Well]([url](https://thewelltoronto.com/)), its name deriving from Wellington Street, the street that flanks the property, is a residential complex and shopping mall with varied uses. The location is calming with interesting architectural design. The design is phenomenal, allowing many different amenities to be provided in a fairly small area, without making it feel crowded.
