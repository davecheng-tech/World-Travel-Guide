Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, [The Bentway](https://thebentway.ca/event/winter-skating-opening-day/) offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

[The Great Wall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China) is located in Beijing. It shows how ancient Chinese people defended their homeland. The Great Wall has many observation decks. When the enemy is coming, the soldier will set up a fire to warn the next observation deck. This way the message will be sent to the emperor really quickly.
