Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)

[St. Peter's Basilica](https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/) is a phenomenal church located in Vatican City and is one of the most sought-after destinations in Rome. A classic example of Renaissance architecture, the church is not only the spiritual core of the Catholic church, but also a treasure trove of historic, religious, and artistic masterpieces of Michelangelo, Bernini, and others. Buried over the site of St Peter’s martyrdom, the Basilica hosts much of the Pope’s liturgies. (Contributor: Justin M)
