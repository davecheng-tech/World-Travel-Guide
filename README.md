Nestled beneath the Gardiner Expressway, The Bentway offers a uniquely urban ice skating experience in the heart of Toronto. This 220-meter figure-eight trail winds through the city’s underpass, surrounded by modern art installations and twinkling lights, creating a one-of-a-kind winter atmosphere. With skate rentals, hot drinks, and a lively community vibe, it’s a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. (Contributor: D. Cheng)
